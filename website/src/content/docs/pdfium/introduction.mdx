# PDFium JavaScript API

The `@embedpdf/pdfium` library provides a JavaScript interface to PDFium, a powerful PDF rendering engine. This documentation will help you understand how to use the library effectively, even if you have no prior experience with C++ or WebAssembly.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @embedpdf/pdfium
```

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { init } from '@embedpdf/pdfium';

const pdfiumWasm = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@embedpdf/pdfium/pdfium.wasm';

async function initializePdfium() {
  const response = await fetch(pdfiumWasm);
  const wasmBinary = await response.arrayBuffer();
  const pdfium = await init({ wasmBinary });
  return pdfium;
}

const pdfium = await initializePdfium();
```

## Understanding WebAssembly and Memory Management

PDFium is a C++ library compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), which allows it to run in web browsers. When you use `@embedpdf/pdfium`, you're interacting with this compiled code through JavaScript.

### Memory Management Basics

When working with PDFium, you need to understand a few key concepts:

1. **Memory Allocation**: You need to allocate memory for data you want to pass to PDFium.
2. **Pointers**: These are references to locations in memory.
3. **Memory Cleanup**: You must free allocated memory when you're done to prevent memory leaks.

```typescript
// Allocate memory
const ptr = pdfium.pdfium.wasmExports.malloc(size);

// Use the memory...

// Free memory when done
pdfium.pdfium.wasmExports.free(ptr);
```

## Core Concepts

### Document Handling

PDFium operations typically follow this workflow:

1. Load a document
2. Perform operations (render pages, extract text, etc.)
3. Close the document and free resources

### Function Categories

The PDFium API consists of functions with different purposes:

- **Document functions**: Open, close, and manage PDF documents
- **Page functions**: Load, render, and manipulate pages
- **Text functions**: Extract and search text
- **Annotation functions**: Work with PDF annotations
- **Form functions**: Interact with PDF forms
- **Bookmark functions**: Work with PDF bookmarks

## Best Practices

1. **Always free memory**: Use `pdfium.pdfium.wasmExports.free()` to release memory allocated with `malloc`.
2. **Close resources**: Always close pages, text pages, and documents when you're done with them.
3. **Use try/finally blocks**: Ensure resources are properly cleaned up even if errors occur.
4. **Check return values**: Many PDFium functions return 0 or null on failure.
5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Use `FPDF_GetLastError()` to get more information about failures.
